# Dashboard - frontend developer recruitment task 

## The task
Your job is to code a simple dashboard. The source file is an `.xd` file. To open it you&#39;ll need Adobe XD software. You can download it here: [http://adobe.ly/xd](http://adobe.ly/xd).
 
## Source file:

[Pagepro_recruitment_task-dashboard.xd](https://github.com/Pagepro/frontend-recruitment-task-dashboard/raw/master/Pagepro_recruitment_task-dashboard.xd)

![Task preview](https://github.com/Pagepro/frontend-recruitment-task-dashboard/blob/master/dashboard_preview.png?raw=true)

It has been designed created by Kasper Christensen and can be found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4857631-Chatbot-UI-Kit-Freebie-xd).

## Must-have:

1. Write the markup using HTML5.
2. Style the page using Sass preprocessor.
3. The site has to be responsive. The breakpoints are to be taken from the provided `.xd` file.
4. The design should be fluid, i.e. grid columns&#39; widths should be defined by percentage rather than fixed pixels (in this case it&#39;s only the boxes&#39; widths) so it scales well on greater resolutions. Tip: distances between the columns should be defined by fixed pixel values.
5. The website uses a custom SF Pro font. It can be found from  [a github repository](https://github.com/blaisck/sfwin) (make sure to include and define it properly by loading from a specific file!). If you struggle with it, you can use an Open Sans webfont from google fonts instead.
6. All the interactive elements (buttons, links, fields, etc.) need to have their active states styled and have smooth transitions.
7. The icons should be exported and used as SVG.


## Good to have:

1. Responsive version for mobile where each of the boxes break into a new line and are full-width. Because this approach resembles &quot;mobile first&quot;, where you decide to put a breakpoint is up to you. Just make sure it looks great!
2. Bootstrap your project using [LibSasserPlate](https://github.com/Pagepro/libsasserplate) library.
3. Create the layout based on either flexbox or grid.
4. Use CSS variables.
5. Use BEM naming methodology.
6. Add a script to remove a question by clicking on the bin icon on its action bar. You don&#39;t have to worry about an &quot;add&quot; button or saving the state (it can go back to the hard-coded state when refreshed).
7. Add a script to increase improvements questions&#39; (the boxes on the dark background) upvote and downvote count upon clicking the corresponding icon. Once again, you don&#39;t need to worry about saving the state.


## Don&#39;ts:

1. Don&#39;t use pre-existing solutions. This includes any frameworks like bootstrap, foundation. We want to see how **you** would approach a problem like grid creation, not how such a library does.
2. If you decide to do the custom scripting, avoid jQuery. Use Javascript DOM API instead.
3. Don&#39;t style selects&#39; options (don&#39;t confuse with the main select field!).


## Support the following browsers:

1. Firefox (latest)
2. Chrome (latest)
3. Edge (latest)
4. Internet Explorer 11
5. Safari (latest)


## What will we be paying attention to:

1. Validity of the HTML and CSS (Sass) markup - make sure to run your HTML code by the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
2. Consistency in the elements naming.
3. Reusability of the elements and the styles.
4. Code repetitions and reusability (keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)).
5. Esthetics sense based on the custom solutions (animations, transitions, etc.).
6. Attention to detail.
7. Code optimization and the solution&#39;s performance.
8. Working in accordance with good practices in general.
9. Consistency of the page looks across the supported browsers.
